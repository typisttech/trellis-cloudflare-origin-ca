Add [Cloudflare Origin CA](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-ca-encryption-origin/) to [Trellis](https://github.com/roots/trellis) as a [SSL provider](https://roots.io/trellis/docs/ssl/)

## Why?

Short answer: To keep connection between Cloudflare and your severs private and secure from tampering.

Long answer:
> Cloudflare’s Flexible SSL mode is the default for Cloudflare sites on the Free plan. Flexible SSL mode means that traffic from browsers to Cloudflare will be encrypted, but traffic from Cloudflare to a site's origin server will not be. To take advantage of our [Full and Strict SSL](https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl) mode—which encrypts the connection between Cloudflare and the origin server—it’s necessary to install a certificate on the origin server.

### What are the benefits of Cloudflare Origin CA over Let's Encrypt?

To get certificates from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), you have to first disable Cloudflare because Cloudflare hides actual server IPs and make Let's Encrypt challenges fail. Using Cloudflare Origin CA simplifies the troubles.

### What are the benefits of Cloudflare Origin CA over other public certificates?

See [Introducing Cloudflare Origin CA](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-ca-encryption-origin/#whataretheincrementalbenefitsoforigincaoverpubliccertificates) on Cloudflare blog.

wordpress_sites:
  example.com:
    # Your Cloudflare account must own all these domains
    site_hosts:

## Requirements

* [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) 2.10 or later
* [Trellis@c86d8a0](https://github.com/roots/trellis/commit/c86d8a042da811e89aa7fdda08159dc86f65be77) or later
* [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) account
* Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic) or 20.04 (Focal)

## Installation

Add this role to `galaxy.yml`:

```yaml
- src: TypistTech.trellis-cloudflare-origin-ca # Case-sensitive!
  version: 0.8.0 # Check for latest version!
```

Run `$ trellis galaxy install`

## Hacking Trellis' Playbook

Add this role to `server.yml` **immediately after** `role: wordpress-setup`:

```diff
    roles:
      # ...
-     - { role: wordpress-setup, tags: [wordpress, wordpress-setup, letsencrypt] }
+     - { role: wordpress-setup, tags: [wordpress, wordpress-setup, letsencrypt, cloudflare-origin-ca] }
+     - { role: TypistTech.trellis-cloudflare-origin-ca, tags: [cloudflare-origin-ca, wordpress-setup], when: sites_using_cloudflare_origin_ca | count }
      # ...
```

Note: `role: wordpress-setup` is tagged with `cloudflare-origin-ca`.

## Nginx Includes

This role templates Nginx SSL directives out to `{{ nginx_path }}/includes.d/{{ item.key }}/cloudflare-origin-ca.conf`. Trellis includes this file [here](https://github.com/roots/trellis/blob/4cd1be12a8cfacf78af3a9a1302bea153f80e459/roles/wordpress-setup/templates/wordpress-site.conf.j2#L106) and [here](https://github.com/roots/trellis/pull/879/files) by default, no action needed.

If you using [Nginx child templates](https://roots.io/trellis/docs/nginx-includes/#child-templates), add this line into your server blocks:
```
include includes.d/{{ item.key }}/cloudflare-origin-ca.conf;
```

## Common Errors

### No site is using Cloudflare Origin CA

Obviously, you should not run this role when you don't use Cloudflare Origin CA.

### `vault_cloudflare_origin_ca_key` is not defined

Encrypt your Cloudflare Origin CA Key in `group_vars/<environment>/vault.yml`. See [role variables](#role-variables).

### `example.com` is using Cloudflare Origin CA but OCSP stapling is enabled

> ... you're trying to staple OCSP responses with Origin CA. Right now OCSP is not supported with Origin CA, so you should remove the ssl_staping directive for the host that you're using the Origin CA cert on...
>
> --- Cloudflare Support

Cloudflare Origin CA doesn't support OCSP stapling. Disable OCSP stapling for all sites using Cloudflare Origin CA. See [role variables](#role-variables).

### `key_type` is deprecated. Please remove it from `example.com`

To avoid misconfiguration, the `key_type` (ECDSA or RSA) and `key_size` (bits) options are deprecated. Since v0.8, this role generates 521-bit ECDSA keys only.

If you had previsously generated CA certificates with other configurations:
1. remove the CA certificates from servers
1. revoke the CA certificates via Cloudflare dashboard
1. re-provision the servers

### `key_size` is deprecated. Please remove it from `example.com`

To avoid misconfiguration, the `key_type` (ECDSA or RSA) and `key_size` (bits) options are deprecated. Since v0.8, this role generates 521-bit ECDSA keys only.

If you had previsously generated CA certificates with other configurations:
1. remove the CA certificates from servers
1. revoke the CA certificates via Cloudflare dashboard
1. re-provision the servers

### Nginx directories not included

Make sure you have [roots/trellis@f2b8107](https://github.com/roots/trellis/commit/f2b81074c83475837e544a8aa5c3e909e760aa8a) or later.

### 400 Bad Request - No required SSL certificate was sent

Symptoms:
* Server returns "400 Bad Request - No required SSL certificate was sent" for all requests
* Nginx logged "client sent no required SSL certificate while reading client request headers, client: [redacted], server:[redacted], request: "GET / HTTP/1.1", host: "[redacted]""
* `ssl_verify_client on;` somewhere in Nginx config files
* Using `client_cert_url` in `wordpress_sites.yml`, i.e: [roots/trellis#869](https://github.com/roots/trellis/pull/869)

Culprit:

Your [Authenticated Origin Pulls](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/204899617) configuration is incorrect.

Fact:

This role has nothing to do with Authenticated Origin Pulls or `ssl_verify_client`.

Solution:
1. Read [Introducing Cloudflare Origin CA](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-ca-encryption-origin/#whataretheincrementalbenefitsoforigincaoverpubliccertificates)
1. Read [Authenticated Origin Pulls](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/204899617)
1. Understand this role is Cloudflare Origin CA
1. Understand Cloudflare Origin CA and Authenticated Origin Pulls are 2 different things
1. Read [#34](https://github.com/TypistTech/trellis-cloudflare-origin-ca/issues/3)
1. Contact Cloudflare support if you still have questions

## FAQ

### Why only 521-bit ECDSA keys allowed?

>I assume you would like to setup [Authenticated Origin Pulls](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/204899617-Authenticated-Origin-Pulls) with Cloudflare. I would recommend ECDSA, as elliptic curves provide the same security with less computational overhead.
>
>Find out more about [ECDSA: The digital signature algorithm of a better internet](https://blog.cloudflare.com/ecdsa-the-digital-signature-algorithm-of-a-better-internet/)
>The above article also mentioned that: According to the [ECRYPT II recommendations](http://www.keylength.com/en/3/) on key length, a 256-bit elliptic curve key provides as much protection as a 3,248-bit asymmetric key.Typical RSA keys in website certificates are 2048-bits. So, I think going with 256-bits ECDSA will be a good choice.

### Why Cloudflare Origin CA key is logged even `cloudflare_origin_ca_no_log` is `true`?

> Note that the use of the `no_log` attribute does not prevent data from being shown when debugging Ansible itself via the `ANSIBLE_DEBUG` environment variable.
